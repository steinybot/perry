//! Scope-local bindings with an O(1) name→position index (#5267).
//!
//! The lowerer resolves every identifier reference by finding the
//! innermost (most-recently-pushed) binding with a given name. The old
//! representation was a bare `Vec<(String, LocalId, Type)>` scanned with a
//! reverse `find`/`rposition` per reference, so a scope holding N bindings
//! with N references lowered in **O(n²)** time. Real minified/bundled JS
//! puts tens of thousands of bindings and references in one module (or one
//! wrapper-function) scope, so `check-lower` stalled for minutes and got
//! killed with no diagnostic on large bundles.
//!
//! `Locals` keeps the same ordered stack (`entries`, the authoritative
//! source of truth) plus a side `index` mapping each name to the ascending
//! list of positions in `entries` that currently hold that name. The *last*
//! position in a name's list is the innermost binding, so `lookup`,
//! `lookup_index`, and `lookup_type` are O(1).
//!
//! Every operation that moves a binding's position (`push`, `drain_from`,
//! `extend`, `remove`) goes through an inherent method here that keeps
//! `index` in sync. Read-only and in-place ops (`iter`, `iter_mut`,
//! slicing, `len`) reach the underlying slice via `Deref`/`DerefMut` —
//! those never move a binding or rename it, so the index stays valid. Note
//! `DerefMut` hands out `&mut [..]` (a slice), **not** `&mut Vec`, so
//! callers cannot bypass the index with `Vec::push`/`remove`/`truncate`.
