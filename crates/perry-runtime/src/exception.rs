//! Exception handling runtime for Perry.
//!
//! Two transports behind one handler stack (#7302):
//!
//! * **Generated `try`/`catch`** (`js_eh_try_push`, `HandlerKind::Unwind`):
//!   `js_throw` raises through the system unwinder
//!   (`_Unwind_RaiseException`; `RaiseException` on Windows) and the
//!   frame's `landingpad`/`catchpad` receives control — see `crate::eh`.
//! * **Rust-side boundary traps** (`js_try_push` + `ffi::setjmp`,
//!   `HandlerKind::Setjmp`): runtime helpers that drive user JS from a
//!   Rust-owned context (`js_call_catching`, promise combinators, iterator
//!   trampolines) catch via `longjmp` — Rust cannot catch a foreign
//!   exception, and this is sound because an open Rust handler is always
//!   innermost when it is the throw target (handler-stack order mirrors
//!   stack order), so a raise never crosses one, and the frames a longjmp
//!   discards are never resumed.

///
/// A #7154-class rooting bug surfaces as an uncaught `TypeError` in a function
/// that is nowhere near the code that lost the value, and the JS-level `stack`
/// this path already prints reads `at <anonymous>` — one frame, no name. The
/// native stack, in contrast, names every compiled JS frame: `--debug-symbols`
/// keeps 1726 `_perry_fn_*` / `_perry_closure_*` symbols in the corpus binary,
/// so `backtrace_symbols_fd` resolves the whole chain through `dladdr`.
///
/// The obvious alternative — run the failing binary under a debugger and break
/// on the throw helper — was tried first for #7803 and is NOT equivalent: the
/// failure is intermittent, and under `lldb` the same seeds that fail natively
/// pass. An instrument that only works when the bug does not reproduce is not
/// an instrument. This one runs in the ordinary process, so it observes the
/// run that actually fails.
///
/// Off by default and read once per uncaught throw, i.e. at most once per
/// process, on a path that is already about to `exit(1)`.
///
/// Parsed by VALUE, not by presence: `PERRY_GC_DIAG` was `var_os(..).is_some()`
/// for long enough that `PERRY_GC_DIAG=0` ENABLED diagnostics and silently
/// collapsed one arm of an A/B (ZOD-NOTES §3, fixed in #7993). A new knob does
