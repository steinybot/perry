//! One thread-local resolution for the whole allocation hot path (#7469).
//!
//! # Why this exists
//!
//! On Darwin every `thread_local!` access is an out-of-line call to
//! `_tlv_get_addr` in `libdyld`. Unlike ELF's `local-exec` / `initial-exec`
//! models it is a real call — not inlined, not cached across accesses, and it
//! clobbers caller-saved registers at the site. LLVM *can* CSE repeated
//! accesses to the **same** thread-local within a function, but two different
//! thread-locals are two different descriptors, so N distinct thread-locals on
//! one code path cost N calls no matter how well the path inlines.
//!
//! The runtime declares 237 `thread_local!` blocks, and a single
//! `{v, w}` object literal touches roughly a dozen of them: the arena and its
//! inline bump state, the free-list flag, the birth-flag cell, the layout side
//! tables, the page-generation cache the write barrier classifies against, and
//! the temp-root stack. Measured on `gc-handoff/bench/churn.ts` at
//! `351742d30`, `_tlv_get_addr` was **34.2% of all self time** — more than the
//! allocation work it was gating, and invisible to `PERRY_GC_TRACE` because it
//! is mutator time, not pause time.
//!
//! # What this does
//!
//! [`HotTls`] caches the **addresses** of those thread-locals in one
//! `const`-initialised thread-local. The storage does not move: every field is
//! the address of the existing `thread_local!` in its owning module, so
//! initialisation order, lazy init, and destructor registration are all
//! unchanged. A hot path that used to pay N `_tlv_get_addr` calls now pays one
//! (for `HOT` itself, which LLVM then CSEs across the whole inlined region)
//! plus N loads from one cache line.
//!
//! # Do not add a field — declare with [`crate::perry_thread_local`]
//!
//! The sixteen named fields below are a **closed set**. They are the
//! allocation path, they have fixed offsets, and they are kept because a fixed
//! offset is one load cheaper than a claimed slot on the hottest path in the
//! runtime. Nothing else belongs there.
//!
//! Adding one used to take four manual steps — slot, `…_hot_addr()` provider,
//! a line in [`fill`], and a line in
//! `tests::cached_addresses_match_thread_locals` — and step four was
//! load-bearing, because the slots are untyped (`*mut u8`) so a mis-wired
//! `fill` would hand out a correctly-typed reference to the *wrong* object.
//!
//! That contract cannot scale to ~520 declarations, and it gets the default
//! backwards: forgetting it produces a **working slow path**, not a build
//! error. Which is why this cost was fixed three times and came back three
//! times — measured 0% of `churn_alloc` after #7565 (`churn` is covered by
//! construction), 8-9% later, 11% on `interp`/`retain`, and 20.5% of
//! `asyncpipe`, whose Map/Set registries, buffer brands and descriptor state
//! were on nobody's list.
//!
//! [`crate::perry_thread_local`] is the default now: same syntax as
//! `thread_local!`, same `with`/`try_with` at every call site, and the address
//! lands in a generic slot of this same cache with **nothing to wire**. The
//! declaration generates its own storage, its own resolver and its own typed
//! key, so the cross-cast hazard above cannot be expressed — and it installs a
//! teardown guard exactly when the value has a destructor, which the named
//! fields do not have at all. `scripts/check_thread_locals.py` makes a new raw
//! `thread_local!` a build error unless it is recorded as deliberately cold,
//! and `scripts/tls_budget_gate.sh` measures the outcome on two programs whose
//! paths are deliberately *not* among these sixteen.
//!
//! # Lifetime
//!
//! The accessors hand out `&'static` references. That is sound for the *cache*
//! (const-init, no `Drop`, so it is never destroyed) and carries exactly the
//! same thread-teardown exposure the runtime already has for `ARENA` and
//! `INLINE_STATE`, whose raw pointers are handed to generated code by
//! `js_inline_arena_state`. It is not an invitation to send one across
//! threads, and the pointee types (`Cell`, `RefCell`, `UnsafeCell`) are all
//! `!Sync`, so the compiler refuses that on its own.
//!
//! # Reaching the cache without a TLS resolution (#7469 structural half)
//!
//! Caching the addresses removed the *per-field* resolutions but left one:
//! `HOT` is itself a `thread_local!`, so every runtime function that reads any
//! hot field still paid one `_tlv_get_addr` call. Symbolicated on the pinned
//! quiet host at `9938cbc1a`, that residue was **27.0% of `churn_alloc`**, and
//! its call-graph attribution was not diffuse: **seven functions carried 98%
//! of it, and every one of the seven resolves `HOT`** —
//! `write_barrier_decoded_parent` (19.3%), `layout_forget_object` (18.9%),
//! `js_object_alloc_class_inline_keys` (18.5%), `arena_alloc` (14.9%),
//! `js_write_barrier_slot` (9.2%), `barrier_child_prologue` (8.8%) and
//! `typed_shape_layout_entry` (8.4%). Two of them resolve *nothing else*.
//!
//! So the structural fix is to make reaching `HOT` free rather than to thread a
//! context pointer through 2994 `.with()` sites. On Apple aarch64 the pthread
//! thread-specific-data array is directly addressable from `TPIDRRO_EL0` —
//! that is how `pthread_getspecific` itself is implemented, and what mimalloc
//! (already linked into this runtime) does on this platform. Publishing the
//! cache's address into one `pthread_key_create` slot turns the resolution
//! from an out-of-line call that clobbers caller-saved registers into `mrs` +
//! two loads that LLVM can CSE across a whole function.
//!
//! [`darwin_tsd`] carries the self-check that makes this safe to ship: the
//! publishing thread reads the slot back through the direct path and compares
//! it against what `pthread_setspecific` was handed. A mismatch — the shape a
//! future OS change would take — disables the direct path process-wide and
//! every thread falls back to `_tlv_get_addr`, permanently and silently
//! correctly. It cannot degrade into reading a wrong address.
