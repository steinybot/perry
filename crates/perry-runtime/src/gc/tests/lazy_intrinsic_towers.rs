//! #7251/#8002: lazy intrinsic-tower builders need #7217's NO-MOVE WINDOW,
//! and every realm must own the tower roots that point into its arena.
//!
//! `object::iterator_prototypes::build_iterator_prototypes`,
//! `object::global_this::generator::build_generator_tower` and
//! `object::global_this::typed_array::ensure_typed_array_intrinsic` have the
//! identical shape #7217 fixed for `populate_global_this_builtins`: each
//! builds an IMMORTAL object graph (hanging off an agent-local intrinsic root
//! for the life of the thread) by threading raw `*mut ObjectHeader` /
//! `*mut ClosureHeader` locals across a dozen-plus allocating installs. A
//! relocating — or even a non-relocating, freeing — collection reached from
//! one of THEIR OWN allocations leaves the rest of the build writing through
//! a dangling or from-space address: none of those locals is a root the
//! collector knows about, so a mark-sweep that runs before they are stored
//! into the (rooted) AtomicI64 slots considers them garbage. Same invariant,
//! same fix (`crate::gc::GcSuppressScope`), applied at the top of each.
//!
//! Both are reachable ahead of `populate_global_this_builtins` on the
//! allocation-point route: `generator_prototype_ptr` /
//! `generator_function_prototype_of` are called from the codegen-emitted
//! `js_generator_attach_prototype` / `js_generator_attach_closure_prototype`
//! helpers on literally the first `gen()` call in a program that has not yet
//! touched `globalThis`, and `ensure_typed_array_intrinsic` is reachable the
//! same way from `typedarray_props.rs:812`.
//!
//! # Why #7217 could not gate this directly, and what changed
//!
//! Filed rather than shipped ungated, per CLAUDE.md's knob-kill policy. Four
//! attempts at a gate — the three the issue records, plus one made here —
//! all passed with the window deleted before this shape was found.
//!
//! 1. **Arm a collection and let ordinary allocation reach it**, the way
//!    `global_bootstrap.rs` does for the ~1.15 MB `populate_global_this_builtins`
//!    bootstrap. A tower is three orders of magnitude smaller and fits inside
//!    one arena block's tail, so it can reach `gc_check_trigger()` not at all —
//!    the test measured nothing. FIXED HERE by
//!    [`force_next_general_arena_alloc_slow`]: pre-fill the current block to
//!    (very nearly) full before calling the builder, so the builder's own
//!    first allocation unconditionally takes the slow path that calls
//!    `gc_check_trigger()`, regardless of how small the tower is. This is the
//!    same lever `gc::tests::runtime_roots::generator_attach_prototype`'s
//!    #7577 gate uses to land a collection inside a specific callee's own
//!    allocation.
//!
//! 2. **Re-exec the test binary so the child is the first to touch a tower.**
//!    The intrinsic-tower statics were plain process-global `AtomicI64`s,
//!    built exactly once per *process* — so whichever test happened to run
//!    first on that binary (libtest's ordering is not something a single test
//!    controls) built them for every other test, including a freshly
//!    re-exec'd child, because OTHER tests in the SAME binary run before this
//!    one and touch `globalThis`. FIXED HERE by converting the statics
//!    (`TYPED_ARRAY_INTRINSIC_PTR`, `TYPED_ARRAY_INTRINSIC_PROTO_PTR`,
//!    `GENERATOR_FUNCTION_INTRINSIC_PTR`, `GENERATOR_INTRINSIC_PROTO_PTR`,
//!    `GENERATOR_PROTOTYPE_PTR`, `ASYNC_GENERATOR_FUNCTION_INTRINSIC_PTR`,
//!    `ASYNC_GENERATOR_INTRINSIC_PROTO_PTR`, `ASYNC_GENERATOR_PROTOTYPE_PTR`)
//!    in `object/mod.rs` from bare process statics to `perry_thread_local!`
//!    backing slots. Each libtest thread therefore gets a guaranteed-first
//!    touch, and shipped `perry/thread` agents no longer reuse another realm's
//!    raw arena pointers (#8002).
//!
//! 3. **Record `gc_is_suppressed()` from inside the builder under
//!    `#[cfg(test)]`.** Reported *suppressed* even with the scope removed,
//!    which turned out to be attempt 2's ordering hazard again in a different
//!    guise: `populate_global_this_builtins` itself opens a `GcSuppressScope`
//!    and calls both builders INSIDE it, so a probe that let ANY earlier test
//!    reach `js_get_global_this()` first would forever after read `true`.
//!    This test structurally avoids that by calling the tower builder
//!    directly, never through `populate_global_this_builtins` /
//!    `js_get_global_this()` — there is no outer window to be confused with.
//!
//! 4. **Arm the ArenaBytes/malloc byte-threshold trigger** (`GC_NEXT_TRIGGER_BYTES`
//!    via `GcTriggerThresholdTestGuard::make_arena_trigger_due`, the lever
//!    `gc::tests::runtime_roots::generator_attach_prototype` uses) under
//!    `force_legacy_gc_pacing`. **This PASSED with the scope removed, on the
//!    first draft of this very file, and would have shipped a vacuous gate.**
//!    The reason: `gc_check_trigger`'s nursery-churn branch only runs a
//!    synchronous, completes-on-the-spot collection when
//!    `gc_scavenge_enabled() || gc_moving_loop_polls_enabled() ||
//!    registered_root_scanners_block_budgeted_gc()` — with legacy pacing
//!    (scavenge and polls both off) and no scanner registered, an ArenaBytes
//!    trigger being "due" just starts a *budgeted* cycle that needs an
//!    explicit `gc_runtime_safepoint()` pump to advance. Nothing pumps one
//!    inline, so `gc_collection_count()` never moves whether or not the
//!    builder is suppressed — the assertion below would have been comparing
//!    two numbers that could never differ. FIXED HERE by arming
//!    `GC_OLD_RECLAIM_PENDING` instead (exactly `global_bootstrap.rs`'s own
//!    lever): the `OldReclaim` branch in `gc_check_trigger` has no such
//!    gating — `!gc_budgeted_cycle_active() &&
//!    matches!(gc_budgeted_due_trigger(), Some(OldReclaim)) &&
//!    !GC_OLD_RECLAIM_IN_PROGRESS` — and calls
//!    `gc_collect_full_mark_sweep_with_trigger` SYNCHRONOUSLY the moment it is
//!    reached, under any pacing. Combined with attempt 1's block-filling (so
//!    the tiny tower's first allocation reaches `gc_check_trigger` AT ALL),
//!    this is the first version verified — by actually deleting the fix and
//!    watching the test go red — to test anything.
//!
//! # Both halves are asserted (CLAUDE.md's fourth way a gate cannot fail)
//!
//! Each test below arms ONE pending collection, shows the builder does not
//! service it, and then shows the SAME armed request IS serviced by ordinary
//! allocation once the builder has returned — proving the arming was live
//! rather than merely absent, exactly as `global_bootstrap.rs` does for
//! `populate_global_this_builtins`.
//!
//! **SABOTAGE, run by hand and not merely asserted:** commenting out either
//! `let _no_move = crate::gc::GcSuppressScope::new();` line (generator.rs:602,
//! typed_array.rs:436) turns its test red —
//! `a collection ran inside build_generator_tower / ensure_typed_array_intrinsic`
//! — confirming attempt 4's mechanism actually observes the fix, unlike
//! attempts 1-4's own false starts above.
