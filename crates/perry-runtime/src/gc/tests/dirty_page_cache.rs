//! #7187 Phase B — the write barrier's "this page is already dirty" cache.
//!
//! Kept in its own file rather than appended to `barrier.rs`, which is already
//! at the 2 000-line cap `scripts/check_file_size.sh` enforces.
//!
//! Four tests, shaped so that each one **asserts its own subject was live**
//! (CLAUDE.md failure mode #4). A cache that never populated would make every
//! "nothing broke" assertion here pass while proving nothing, which is exactly
//! how `PERRY_GC_FORCE_EVACUATE` stayed inert for months (#6942/#6946). So the
//! counters are read under a forced trace guard — not `if tracing { … }`, which
//! skips the assertion entirely in the default `cargo test` run — and every
//! test states a non-zero `dirty_page_cache_hits`.
//!
//! What is under test, in one line each:
//!
//!   1. the fast path fires, and a genuinely NEW page is never swallowed by it,
//!   2. the clear invalidates it — the sabotage-sensitive one: without this the
//!      page is lost from the modbuf forever, which is a missed old→young edge,
//!   3. a real minor collection whose stores were overwhelmingly cache hits
//!      still has complete old→young coverage and does not free the child,
//!   4. the arena's per-page `dirty` stamp never drifts behind the modbuf.
