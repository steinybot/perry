//! Precise GC roots read from native frames, via LLVM statepoints.
//!
//! Under `PERRY_RS4GC=1` the compiler runs `RewriteStatepointsForGC`, which
//! records each live root as an LLVM-owned spill slot for a `gc.relocate`
//! value: a writable, frame-register-relative location in the emitted
//! stack-map section. This module finds that section in the running image,
//! walks the native frames, and hands each live slot to the collector as a
//! `MutableRootSlot` — mutable because evacuation rewrites through it.
//!
//! A second lowering used to exist, placing `llvm.experimental.stackmap`
//! before mapped calls and recording alloca addresses directly. It was
//! unsound and is deleted; only the statepoint path remains, so there is no
//! backend selection here and no fallback between them.
//!
//! Platform support is per-shape, not one target: Apple (macOS/iOS/iPadOS/
//! tvOS/watchOS) reads a concatenated `__PERRY_GCMAP` Mach-O section, Linux
//! reads `.perry_gcmap` from ELF, and Windows reads `.pgcmap` from the PE
//! image. Frame walking is per-platform too — an x29 chain walk where the
//! map proves every frame is chain-walkable, the Itanium unwinder elsewhere
//! on Unix, and `RtlVirtualUnwind` on Windows. Targets outside that set
//! return no roots, and the compiler refuses to emit a map for them rather
//! than producing a binary whose collector would silently free live objects.

// x29 is always 16-aligned as well and a `fp & 0xF` test never fires. AAPCS64
// does not promise that: §6.4.6 fixes the record's CONTENTS and leaves its

// lowering puts the `x29,x30` pair *below* the other callee-saved GPRs. With an
// odd number of those, the pair lands 8 mod 16.
//
// Measured on aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu (#7392), from the `.eh_frame` of a
// runtime frame that saves x19..x23 and v8:
//
//     LOC        CFA      x19  x20  x21  x22  x23  x29  ra   v8

// x29 = CFA - 56, and CFA is 16-aligned, so x29 ≡ 8 (mod 16) — a legal frame
// record the 16-byte test rejected. That abandoned the fast walk mid-stack and
// fell back to the unwinder, which had its own SP-base bug (see
// `unwind::walk_frame`), so the frame's roots were never rewritten after an
// evacuation and the mutator then dereferenced a stale from-space pointer.
//
