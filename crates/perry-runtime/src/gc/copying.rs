    //   classifies as `Nursery` and `move_young` is unreachable. Every root
    //   walk, slot rewrite and forwarding repair is therefore a provable no-op,
    //   not an approximation.
    // * **No remembered-set entry can be created** — that is `skip_remembering`'s
    //   existing proof, which this reuses verbatim (it is a precondition here).
    //   With no young generation left, `remembered_set_clear()` is exact.
    // * **The address-keyed death-pruning passes prune nothing anyway.**
    //   `dead_owner::owner_is_dead` and the map/set/error finalizers all require
    //   the owner to classify as `Nursery` on a minor; after the retag none do.
    //   They still run below, and still find nothing, at their usual O(registered
    //   holders) cost.
    // * **Weak semantics need marks**, so a cycle with any weak-target holder
    //   registered is excluded outright.
    // * **The malloc sweep and `Longlived` marking need marks**, so this reuses
    //   `malloc_registry_empty_at_start`.
    // * **The stress/verify instruments need a trace to instrument**, so any of
    //   them being armed excludes this path — an instrument that silently stops
    //   exercising its subject is the failure mode CLAUDE.md's "a gate must
    //   assert its subject was live" rule is about.
    //
    // That leaves liveness for the old-gen page index (answered by

    // fires for collector writes, so its page was never dirty), the next

    // parent's slot kept the previous survivor-space address. zod's schema
    // metadata — built once at module init, promoted after 2 survivals,
    // never written again — is exactly that shape, and the whole-heap
    // from-space scan caught it at scheduled collection #2 of every seeded
    // run: `owner space=Old +120 bare -> Survivor1 MISSING-REWRITE
    // [ever_dirty=false]`, i.e. `never_dirty` — a slot no barrier ever saw.
