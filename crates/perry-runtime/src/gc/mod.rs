//! Mark-sweep garbage collector for Perry
//!
//! Design:
//! - 8-byte GcHeader prepended to every heap allocation (invisible to callers)
//! - Arena objects (arrays/objects): discovered by walking arena blocks linearly (zero per-alloc tracking cost)
//! - Explicit malloc objects (promises/maps/errors, large closures, and compatibility residents): tracked in MALLOC_STATE
//! - Mark phase: precise thread-local roots + optional conservative stack scan + type-specific tracing
//! - Sweep phase: free malloc objects; arena objects added to free list for reuse
//! - Trigger: only checked on new arena block allocation or explicit gc() call
//!
//! Low-pause contract:
//! - Normal automatic GC work and mutator assists must eventually advance in
//!   bounded work-unit steps, independent of heap size.
//! - Explicit `gc()` calls may synchronously run the configured collection
//!   because the caller requested that pause; traces distinguish manual minor
//!   work from explicit full collection.
//! - Emergency full collections are reserved for allocation failure recovery,
//!   only outside suppressed, reentrant, or unsafe regions, and must be
//!   reported separately.
//!
//! Threshold-triggered work in `gc_check_trigger()` is debt-paced: heap goals
//! start or resume a budgeted cycle and allocation-side checks spend bounded
//! mutator-assist work instead of running a whole automatic collection.

// `gc_force_evacuate_enabled()` below.
//
// **It was measured inert where anyone was looking.** On the pinned quiet host,
// identical binaries and protocol, the only difference being the knob, a
// cell-by-cell diff over all 12 gc-ratchet probes × 8 counters
// (`minor_cycles`, `step_cycles`, `copied_objects`, `copied_bytes`,
// `promoted_objects`, `promoted_bytes`, `freed_bytes`, `heap_used_bytes`)
// reported **0 of 96 cells moved** — bit-identical medians, and
// `gc_ratchet.py check` exit 0 with the knob set. For contrast the same
// procedure with `PERRY_GEN_GC=0` moved 79 cells and returned 90 findings, so
// the harness was sensitive and this knob specifically was not. The mechanism:
// the counters the ratchet reads come from the COPYING minor
// (`gc_collect_minor_copying_fast_path`), which this knob never gated; what it
// gated is the non-copying fallback's policy evacuation, which those probes do
// not reach.
//
// **Its one unique live effect was a footgun.** Vetoing
// `gc_force_evacuate_enabled()` meant an ambient `PERRY_GEN_GC_EVACUATE=0`
// silently disarmed the #7154 stress instrument (`PERRY_GC_SCHEDULE_SEED`),
// so a stress run could report "clean" having moved nothing. CLAUDE.md documented that as a
// caveat rather than treating it as the defect it is. Deleting the knob deletes
// the way to disarm the instrument by accident.
//
// **The branch it gated is NOT deleted with it, because the branch has another
// controller that IS exercised.** `evacuation_policy_allowed` is still false on
// every budgeted low-pause cycle (`low_pause_non_moving` in
// `gc_start_budgeted_minor_fallback_cycle_with_snapshot`), and
// `budgeted_low_pause_minor_does_not_evacuate` asserts that arm behaviourally —
// nothing moved, no forwarding stub, old-page selection skipped, and
// `trace.evacuation_policy.reason == "low_pause_non_moving"`. So the losing

///
/// This doc comment previously read "Phase-1 de-risking flag (OFF by default)
/// … NOT sound as a production default yet". Both halves were false for two
/// hundred releases, eight lines above a body comment saying "ON BY DEFAULT" —
/// the #6987 shape CLAUDE.md warns about, and this time the stale half was the
/// one carrying the soundness argument.
///
/// **Kill-policy disposition, stated rather than left implicit — and stated
/// for the configuration that now ships.** The flag's only production reader is
/// the arm condition in `gc_check_trigger`, a three-way disjunction:
/// `gc_scavenge_enabled() || gc_moving_loop_polls_enabled() ||
/// registered_root_scanners_block_budgeted_gc()`.
///
///  * **With polls ON (the default since #7682's follow-up)** the second
///    disjunct carries the arm, and this flag decides nothing. It is redundant,
///    not load-bearing.
///  * **With `PERRY_GC_MOVING_LOOP_POLLS=0`** it is the only thing holding the
///    arm open, and dropping it would route nursery pressure to the budgeted
///    stepper, which is non-moving *and* reclaims almost nothing on a
///    reallocation loop. The third disjunct does NOT rescue that case: under
///    `gc_incremental_enabled()` (the default) it reduces to "any COPY-ONLY
///    scanner", and a compiled program has none — the reasoning
///    `test-parity/gc_matrix_inert_arms.txt` recorded for the `cons_scan_off`
///    arm, and the thing that made a first attempt at repairing
///    `generator_attach_prototype` fail for a third distinct reason.
///
/// So the honest summary is: this knob is now a modifier on the kill switch,
/// not a mode of its own. By CLAUDE.md's rule that is a candidate for deletion —
/// fold its behaviour into the polls-off path and stop having two flags whose
/// interaction nobody exercises. Deliberately NOT done here: this PR already
/// changes two defaults, and a third would make one bisect answer three
/// questions. The decision wants the arm condition's three disjuncts measured
/// on real programs, which is a separate change with a separate A/B.
///
/// An earlier draft of this comment claimed the knob was "very close to inert
/// for a compiled binary" on the strength of the third disjunct holding for
