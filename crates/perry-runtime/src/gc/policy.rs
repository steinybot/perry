///    stopgap was that a poll at every back-edge defeats auto-vectorization;
///    `emit_gc_loop_safepoint` now emits one only where
///    `loop_purity::loop_may_allocate` says the body can allocate, so

    //     `test_memory_json_churn` shape: 5 k iters × ~13 KB per
    //     parse into a fragmented arena, where a small parse can still
    //     force one fresh 1 MB block while GC is suppressed. Allow
    //     repeated bumps here, but clamp them to the collector's
    //     absolute trigger ceiling so a tiny parse loop cannot keep
    //     ratcheting the next GC beyond the RSS guardrail. If a
    //     suppressed parse crosses the trigger, the next pre-parse or
    //     normal allocation check sees the trigger still due.
    //
    //   * Medium-or-larger parses (> 1 MB) — the
    //     `json_pipeline_full` and `json_polyglot` shapes: once per
    //     GC cycle, bump the trigger to grant the post-parse
    //     workload a `step` of headroom. The flag clears in
    //     `gc_collect_inner` so the next cycle gets its own bump.
    //     This is what was missing in commit 56818086 — each
    //     iteration of `json_polyglot`'s 50-iter loop bumped the
    //     trigger by another `step`, and after productive
    //     step-doubling that grew toward 1 GB the trigger ratcheted
    //     hundreds of MB above the actual live set (~5 MB) and GC
    //     never fired across the entire run. Peak RSS climbed to
    //     254/411 MB on the lazy-tape path.
    //
    // Also cap the effective step at the *initial* value (64 MB) so
    // post-`73a48ced` step-doubling can't make a single bump grant

    // this never fires on the common nursery-churn path — run a direct full

    // only genuinely unreachable old blocks are returned.

    // ★ #7148 disposition: **keep, justified, observable — and add a precise
    // path that beats it to the punch.** The first attempt at this site was a
    // deferral like the nursery arm's. It was wrong, and the reasoning is kept
    // because the shape recurs.
    //
    // 1. **The headline RSS argument does not apply here.** A conservative scan
    //    costs +364%..+5371% `heap_used_bytes` on the ratchet probes *because
    //    it makes the copying minor ineligible* — `minor_cycles` → 0. This arm
    //    runs a FULL mark-sweep, which is non-moving with or without the scan.
    //    What the scan costs here is conservative *retention* for one cycle,
    //    not the loss of evacuation. Much smaller, and unmeasured.
    // 2. **Deferring it breaks a tested RSS guarantee.** #5476's regression test
    //    (`check_trigger_drives_old_reclaim_to_completion_without_host_stepping`)
    //    asserts that *a single* `gc_check_trigger` call — what every allocation
    //    does — drives the reclaim to completion, because the workload that
    //    motivated it is a compute-only loop that never reaches a host step. A
    //    deferral makes that "within one 32 MB growth quantum" instead, on the
    //    exact workload whose bug report was titled *RSS climbs unbounded*.
    //    Trading conservative retention for bounded-but-real extra old-gen
    //    residency is not obviously a win, and nothing here measured that it is.
    //
    // So this arm is unchanged, and `gc_safepoint_moving_minor` instead gained
    // the SAME full mark-sweep with precise roots (#7148). Programs that reach a
    // safepoint — every event-loop program — now get their old-gen reclaim
    // precisely and *no later* than before; nothing is delayed for anyone. The
    // fallback is attacked by adding a competing earlier precise path, not by
    // postponing the collection. `ConservativeScanSite::OldReclaimAllocPoint`
    // counts how often the alloc point still gets there first.
    //
    // Default-robustness (#7161 proposes flipping `PERRY_GC_MOVING_LOOP_POLLS`
    // OFF): this arm does not consult that gate at all, so it behaves
    // identically either way. The precise safepoint path is reached from the
    // microtask pump under `gc_moving_safepoint_enabled` (a different knob,
    // untouched by #7161) and from `js_gc_loop_safepoint` only while polls are
    // on. Polls off ⇒ the precise path is reached less often ⇒ this arm fires

    // iterations wrong per route before the `RuntimeHandleScope` routing in

    // loop-polls route makes the COLLECTION POINT precise; keeping runtime
    // frames rooted across it is a separate obligation, discharged by

/// in this project is taken through — `process.memoryUsage()` after `gc()` —
/// carried a stack-residue tax. Measured with `gc_ratchet.py classify` on

/// `01_nursery_churn`, `05_closure_capture`, `06_string_retention` and
/// `11_collect_at_depth` respectively (13.80%, 8,273,888 bytes, on
/// `12_large_live_set` — the case #7558 was filed for was the *smallest* of the
/// four). It was also non-deterministic run to run, because stack residue is,
/// which is why `benchmarks/gc_ratchet` had to stop gating that cell (#7554)
/// and why retention rows were unbelievable without a manual `classify`
/// cross-check (#7559). And it made this path non-moving, which is why
/// `PERRY_GC_FORCE_EVACUATE` was inert for every `gc()`-driven test
/// (#6942/#6946).
///
/// **A second-order effect worth knowing about.** `gc/tenuring.rs` deliberately
/// refuses to seed the adaptive tenuring threshold from a cycle that ran the
/// conservative scan, so on any `gc()`-driven workload that seed had never
/// fired. It fires now. On two ratchet probes `tenuring_survivals` falls
/// `4 -> 1` and survivors are promoted on first copy rather than copied into
/// survivor space; the copying minor still runs and moves *more* objects.
/// Removing a conservative scan is not only a retention change.
///
/// **What is unchanged.** `gc()` is still synchronous — #7148's disposition
