/// * **One epoch bump.** The plan epochs are compared against snapshots for
///   equality ("changed since I cached?"); the two halves of the old sequence
///   run back-to-back on the single mutator thread with no reader in
///   between, so one bump invalidates every snapshot exactly as two did.
/// * **One `note_descriptor_target`.** Its flag writes are idempotent, and
///   its `transition_object_shape_semantics` mints a fresh semantic
///   generation whose only consumer contract is "any cached fact keyed by an
///   older ShapeId is now stale" — one fresh generation retires older ids
///   exactly as two consecutive generations did (nothing can observe the
///   intermediate id: no reader runs between the halves).
/// * **One `disable_inline_guards_for_descriptor_target`.** Both old calls
///   passed the identical `(obj, key)`; the body is idempotent (guard-slot
///   retirement plus a hash-set insert).
/// * **One meta access setting BOTH kind bits** (`accessor_key_bits` /
///   `attr_key_bits`), returning each bit's prior state.
/// * **Owner-index dedupe elided when the kind's meta bit was clear.** The
///   summary's own contract (see `note_meta_descriptor_key` /
///   `may_have_descriptor_entry`: "every insert … whose owner is
///   meta-capable sets the key's bit first, so for such owners a clear bit —
///   or a still-null meta record — proves the tables hold no entry for that
///   key") extends to the owner indexes: every `owner_index_add` site in
///   this file is preceded by the matching-kind `note_meta_descriptor_key`,
///   bits are never cleared, and index removals only shrink the index — so a
///   clear prior bit proves the index holds no entry either, and the O(N)
///   `Vec<String>` dedupe scan (the second-largest term of the __export
///   install profile at 500 keys) can be a plain push. A set prior bit (a
///   Bloom collision, a genuine earlier entry) or a non-meta-capable owner
///   keeps the scanning `owner_index_add`.
///
/// Callers must guarantee the property is brand new on `obj` (the fast arm
/// proves absence via `own_key_present_via_index` /
