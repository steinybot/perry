//! Reserved raw-field floors for built-in iterator objects (#9019).
//!
//! The built-in iterator families (array / map / set / string / buffer /
//! regexp-string iterators, iterator helpers) are ordinary `GC_TYPE_OBJECT`
//! allocations whose internal state — backing collection, cursor, kind,
//! cached result — lives in RAW numbered fields written with
//! `js_object_set_field`, while their keys array starts EMPTY. The by-name
//! append path derives a new key's field index from the keys array, so the
//! first user property (`it.next = fn`, `it.foo = 1`) landed at field index
//! 0 and overwrote the backing-collection pointer. The next builtin
//! `.next()` then read the stored value as a `SetHeader`/`MapHeader`
//! pointer: a NaN-boxed number there reads as a null-ish backing (the
//! iterator silently reports `done: true`), a closure there is dereferenced
//! as a collection header and SIGSEGVs.
//!
//! The fix keeps the keys-position ↔ field-index correspondence every
//! by-name path relies on: before the FIRST by-name append to such a
//! receiver, seed its keys array with `floor` leading tombstones
//! (`TAG_HOLE`, the #9038 hole-delete marker every lookup / enumeration /
//! delete path already skips). User keys then append from `floor` upward —
//! past every raw internal field — and land in the ordinary inline/overflow
//! storage. Unpatched iterators never pay: the seed runs only when user
//! code actually adds a named property.
