//! Per-image class registries (#8546).
//!
//! Every class-id-keyed table that codegen populates at module init —
//! vtables, static methods and accessors, constructors, parent edges, names,
//! `.length`s, the `extends Error` / `DataView` / typed-array marks, the
//! `Symbol.hasInstance` / `Symbol.toStringTag` hooks — used to be a
//! process-global `static`. Class ids are assigned by codegen from a small
//! sequential counter, so they identify a class *within one compiled image*
//! and nothing else. A host that dlopens several application images into one
//! process (Coop hosts each deployment on its own dedicated Perry thread) has N
//! images registering the SAME ids with DIFFERENT `func_ptr`s — each image's
//! own code addresses — into one table. `HashMap::insert` is last-writer-wins,
//! so after the last image's init every class of every earlier image
//! dispatched into the last image's code, and only the last-initialised
//! application worked.
//!
//! No write order over a shared table can work: first-wins for methods only
//! leaves every vtable a mix of two images; first-owner for every entry point
//! leaves later images unable to initialise at all (they both write and read
//! these tables during their own init). The tables have to be per image.
//!
//! # The model
//!
//! An **image** is one compiled program's worth of class metadata,
//! [`ClassImageTables`]. A thread resolves its image in this order:
//!
//! 1. the image installed in its own thread-local slot, if any;
//! 2. otherwise the process's **primary** image — the first image ever
//!    created in the process.
//!
//! Installation happens at exactly three points:
//!
//! * [`enter_current_thread_image`], called from `js_gc_init`, which codegen
//!   emits as the first runtime call of both an executable's `main` and a
//!   library's `perry_module_init` — i.e. on whichever thread runs an image's
//!   module init, before any class is registered. The first thread to enter
//!   creates the primary image and owns it; every later thread that enters
//!   gets a fresh, private image. A host loading three applications on three
//!   threads therefore gets three images, and a plain executable gets one.
//!   Idempotent per thread.
//! * [`adopt_image`], on a `perry/thread` worker (`spawn`, `parallelMap`,
//!   `parallelFilter`) and a `worker_threads` Worker, with the handle its
//!   spawner captured via [`current_image_handle`]. Those threads never run
//!   module init (the closure body is all they execute — see `thread.rs`), so
//!   they must SHARE their spawner's tables rather than start empty.
//! * Nothing else. A thread that neither entered nor adopted — a pump running
//!   JS on the primary heap's behalf (Android's UI thread firing timers via
//!   `nativePumpTick`), a reactor thread, a libtest thread — reads and writes
//!   the primary image, which is exactly the process-global table it saw
//!   before this module existed. A program with one image is behaviourally
//!   unchanged.
//!
//! Why not key by `AgentId` or by thread: `CURRENT_AGENT` defaults to
//! `PRIMARY_AGENT` and a host's app thread is a plain `std::thread::spawn`
//! that never claims an agent, so agent-keying hands every hosted app one
//! table (#8528 hit the same wall). Pure thread-keying breaks the pump threads
//! and the `perry/thread` workers above, which run JS that dispatches through
//! these tables without ever running init.
//!
//! # Call sites
//!
//! Each table is a `static` [`ImageTable`] handle whose `read()` / `write()`
//! resolve the calling thread's image and lock that image's `RwLock` — the
//! same guard types the process-global statics handed out, so the ~100 use
//! sites are unchanged. The guards are `!Send`, so a reference into an image
//! cannot leave the thread that resolved it (see [`current`]).
//!
//! The `RegistryLatch`es that gate the slow paths (`HAS_INSTANCE_LATCH`,
//! `GENERIC_ORIGIN_LATCH`, …) and `VTABLE_GEN` stay process-global on
//! purpose: a latch armed by ANY image only ever costs another image the slow
//! path, never a wrong answer.
