///
/// On `push_cls` / `churn_alloc` / `churn` the array push is the only surviving
/// barrier call site, and `PERRY_GC_TRACE` counts 19,945,222 calls of which
/// 19,743,573 (99.0%) end in `parent_not_old_skips` — with
/// `old_to_young_slow_hits == 0` and `new_inserts == 0`. The remembered set is
/// **never inserted into, not once**, yet the call is made 20 million times and
/// costs ~30% of leaf profile. #7536's value-side test cannot reach any of it:
/// `non_pointer_child_skips == 0`, because the pushed value genuinely *is* a
/// heap pointer. The waste is entirely parent-side.
///
/// ## The two clauses
///
/// The call is skipped only when BOTH are false.
///
/// 1. **`gc_flags & GC_FLAG_TENURED`** — the remembered set exists so a minor
///    GC can skip retracing parents it treats as black leaves. Those are
///    exactly the objects that are physically old-gen
///    (`barrier_parent_needs_remembering`'s `classify_heap_generation == Old`)
///    or logically tenured (`GC_FLAG_TENURED`, whose doc records that a tenured
///    object may stay physically in the nursery while "the trace pretends
///    they're old-gen" — `gc/trace.rs:747`). A parent that is neither is
///    **fully traced by every minor GC**, so the edge is rediscovered and needs
///    no record.
///
///    Soundness rests on `Old ⟹ TENURED`, i.e. `!TENURED ⟹ !Old`, so this
///    predicate can only skip a subset of what the runtime already skips — the
///    same superset discipline `emit_may_carry_heap_pointer_check` uses. Every
///    path that places an object into an old-gen block sets the bit in the same
///    breath, and nothing ever clears it:
///      * `gc/copying.rs:612–637` — one `promote` expression selects
///        `arena_alloc_gc_old` AND `GC_FLAG_TENURED`.
///      * `gc/oldgen.rs:1740`, `gc/oldgen.rs:1838` — evacuation / old-page
///        defrag both OR the bit onto the destination header.
///      * `buffer/header.rs:486`, `typedarray/mod.rs:722` — direct old-gen
///        allocations set it immediately after allocating.
///      * `json_tape.rs` allocates through `arena_alloc_gc_old_born_tenured`.
///    The three sites that write the bit all OR it in; none masks it out.
///
/// 2. **`PERRY_INCREMENTAL_MARK_BARRIER_ACTIVE_COUNT != 0`** — skipping the
///    call also skips `barrier_child_prologue`'s
///    `incremental_mark_barrier_value`, the insertion/SATB shading, which is
///    NOT a generational question and must never be dropped while a cycle is
///    live. A zero count *proves* this thread's
///    `INCREMENTAL_MARK_BARRIER_VALID_PTRS` is null, because
///    `incremental_mark_barrier_enable` increments the count BEFORE installing
///    the thread-local, while disable clears the thread-local BEFORE
///    decrementing the count. This is the same gate, on the same global, that
///    `expr/shadow_inline.rs` and `expr/shadow_slot.rs` already emit for the
///    root shading barrier. It is an LLVM `monotonic` load (Rust `Relaxed`):
///    the counter is authoritative state, not a publication fence for other
///    memory.
///
/// ## Why a live test and not a static claim
///
/// #7501: even a static layout *declaration* is revoked at runtime. Generation
/// is strictly worse — an object's generation changes underneath any static
/// proof the moment a collection promotes it, and `keep` in `chunk()` crosses
/// hundreds of collections between its allocation and its last push. There is
/// no by-construction proof that a parent is young, which is precisely why this
/// reads the live header at the store instead.
///

/// the caller is responsible for having tested that, because this dereferences
/// `parent_handle - 7`.

///   to make free.
///
/// A single fused `and` of the two would do exactly that, which is why this is
/// two branches and not one.
///
/// ## Why skipping on the value test alone is sound
///
/// `write_barrier_slot_inner`'s first action is `barrier_child_prologue(child)`,
/// which returns `None` — before the incremental-mark shading, before the armed
/// check, before the parent decode and before the remembered set — when

/// load-bearing, and `gc::tests::inline_pointer_bearing_contract` enumerates
/// the whole 16-bit tag space against it), so a store this predicate rejects is
/// one the call would have returned from immediately. In particular the SATB /
/// insertion shading is NOT skipped by this half: a value that carries no heap
/// pointer has nothing to shade, which is why the incremental clause lives in
/// the parent test and not here.
///

/// #7511 — a class-field JSValue slot store whose three GC-bookkeeping calls
/// are placed behind ONE inline, live test of the stored value.
///
/// ## Why a live test rather than a wider static proof
///
/// The bookkeeping this guards costs 16.1% of `churn_alloc`'s profile on a
/// program whose stores are all doubles, and #5334 lever D — which elides it
/// for a value that is a non-pointer BY CONSTRUCTION — never fires there. The
/// reason is structural, not a missing arm: since the `[#bloat]`
/// `force_ctor_call` default (`lower_call/new.rs`), a class with its own
/// constructor is NOT inlined at the `new` site. Its body is compiled once as
/// the shared `<class>_constructor(this, p0, …)` symbol, and HIR rewrites every
/// closed-shape object literal into a `New` of a synthesized anon-shape class
/// with exactly that shape (`lower/context.rs::mint_anon_shape_class`). So the
/// expression reaching the field store is `Expr::LocalGet(<ctor param>)` — an
/// LLVM *function argument* of a function shared by every `new` site in the
/// module, including ones passing pointers. No by-construction proof about that
/// value can exist, and a declared `v: number` is not a layout fact (CLAUDE.md,
/// "No runtime type *validation*"): the field legitimately receives a string
/// through an `any`.
///
/// What CAN be decided there is the same question the three callees each ask
/// first, at runtime, one at a time, across three cross-crate calls. Asking it
/// ONCE inline and branching over all three is exactly #7501's shape (a live
/// test at the store standing in for a static claim that cannot be made).
///
/// ## Why each call is dead when the test says "no pointer"
///
/// - `js_write_barrier_slot` → `write_barrier_slot_inner` opens with
///   `barrier_child_prologue`, which returns immediately when
///   `decode_heap_addr(child) == 0`. Nothing else in the barrier runs — not the
///   incremental-mark shading (there is no heap object to shade), not the
///   remembered set (a non-pointer publishes no old→young edge).
/// - `js_string_addref_if_heap_string` is tag-checked and a no-op for every
///   non-`STRING_TAG` value, SSO short strings included.
/// - `js_gc_note_slot_layout` for a non-pointer value can only ever CLEAR mask
///   state, never set it, so skipping it is never the difference between a slot
///   being scanned and a live child being stranded. That is the identical
///   argument `class_field_store_needs_layout_note` already ships for the
///   static case, including its precondition — the caller only reaches here
///   with `requires_raw_f64 == false`, so the note's raw-f64-mask arm (the one
///   that MUST downgrade) is unreachable. Turning a static claim into a live
///   test does not weaken it.
///
/// The store itself stays unconditional and outside the branch — only the
/// bookkeeping moves.
///
/// Callers that already proved the value statically pass all three flags
/// `false`; then no test and no blocks are emitted at all, and lever D's
/// existing elision is unchanged.
///
/// `stem` names the emitted blocks (`<stem>.gc_bookkeeping`,
/// `<stem>.layout_note`, `<stem>.barrier`). It is not cosmetic: the IR census
/// that is the ONLY detector for a deleted barrier (#8185) identifies the arm
/// by its label, so two call sites sharing a stem would let one site's guard
/// satisfy the other site's assertion. The class-field callers pass
/// `"class_field_set"`; the static write PIC (#8184) passes `"put.pic"`.
///
/// ## The parent's half of the same question (#7871)
///
/// The value test answers "does this store publish a heap pointer at all". It
/// does not answer "does anyone need to know" — and for the shape this emitter
/// exists to serve, the answer is almost always no. HIR rewrites every
/// closed-shape object literal into a `new` of a synthesized anon-shape class
/// (`lower/context.rs::mint_anon_shape_class`), so `{ kind: "num", num: n }`
/// reaches the shared `<class>_constructor` and writes its fields into an
/// instance allocated a few instructions earlier **in the nursery**. A nursery
/// parent is fully retraced by every minor GC, so the edge it publishes is
/// rediscovered and the remembered-set record is pure cost.
///
/// The pointer-bearing arm is therefore itself gated on
/// [`emit_parent_may_need_remembering_check`] — the identical predicate
/// `expr/array_push.rs` has carried since #7511, resting on the identical
/// argument. `Old ⟹ TENURED`, so `!TENURED` can only skip a subset of what the
/// runtime already skips; and the predicate's second disjunct is the
/// incremental-cycle count, because skipping the call also skips
/// `barrier_child_prologue`'s SATB shading, which is not a generational
/// question.
///
/// It is a LIVE header test, never a static claim (#7501's shape): a parent
/// promoted between its allocation and this store reads `TENURED` here and
/// takes the barrier. The failure direction is the safe one — a receiver whose
/// generation the compiler cannot see is exactly a receiver whose header it
/// reads.
