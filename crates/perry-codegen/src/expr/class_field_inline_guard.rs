//! #5093: codegen-inlined class-field shape guard.
//!
//! Monomorphic `this.field` reads/writes on a known class instance previously
//! routed every access through a cross-crate
//! `js_typed_feedback_class_field_{get,set}_guard` *call* before touching the
//! raw slot. Measurements in #5093 showed the call itself — not its body — was
//! the dominant cost on the `09_method_calls` benchmark (~290× Node). This
//! emits the cheap part of the guard's contract as inline IR: when the
//! monomorphic shape holds (and, for raw-f64 fields, the per-object typed-layout
//! intact bit is set), control branches straight to the fast slot load/store,
//! skipping the call.
//!
//! NOTE (repsel Phase 3b audit, verified with `--trace llvm` + `opt -O3` on a
//! `this.field`-in-loop method): LLVM LICM does NOT hoist this check out of
//! hot loops. The volatile gate load is never hoistable (volatile ⇒
//! `!isUnordered`), and — decisively — even a plain or `atomic unordered`
//! gate load stays in the loop because the diamond's own guard-call/fallback
//! arm puts an unknown external call inside the loop body, which
//! clobber-blocks LICM for every load in the check. Per-access cost is
//! therefore paid on every iteration. The hoisted form exists as the #5093
//! versioned-loop preheader check (`emit_class_field_loop_preheader_check`,
//! sound only for call-free clone bodies), and statically-proven receivers
//! skip the diamond entirely (`collectors/ptr_shape.rs`). Do not "fix" this
//! by de-volatilizing the gate: it buys nothing (the calls still block LICM)
//! and weakens the mid-loop sticky-flip visibility guarantee for loops whose
//! bodies CAN flip the gate through a call.
//!
//! The inline check is a strict subset of `class_field_fast_contract` (runtime
//! `typed_feedback/guards.rs`): if it passes, the guard call would have returned
//! "fast". On any miss it falls through to the unchanged guard-call path, so the
//! optimization is purely additive — it can never take the fast path the guard
//! would have rejected. The single per-object `GC_OBJ_TYPED_LAYOUT_INTACT` bit
//! (runtime `gc/layout.rs`) stands in for the thread-local raw-f64 layout probe:
//! it is set exactly when the object's canonical typed descriptor is installed
//! and cleared on any downgrade, so "intact bit set + class_id/keys match" ⟹
//! "slot K is raw-f64" for any field the class declares as a raw-f64 candidate.

/// and an accessor anywhere on the chain makes `class_field_global_index`
/// return `None`). The raw-f64 candidacy of the declared type is likewise
/// re-checked per subclass: the fast path reads/writes the slot as a bare
/// double, and the per-object typed-layout intact bit only licenses that for a
/// field the *matched* class declares as a raw-f64 candidate.

/// user class id. That call already rejects the handle band, the built-in
/// Set/Map/RegExp registries, out-of-heap-range addresses, and any allocation
/// whose `GcHeader.obj_type` is not `GC_TYPE_OBJECT`
/// (`object/field_get_set/field_ops.rs`). So every predicate
/// [`emit_class_field_inline_precheck`] evaluates *before* its dereference is
/// already discharged, and the loads below need no gate/deref split — they all
/// fit in the caller's single basic block.
///
/// ## What is left, and why each one
///
/// * **ShapeId identity** — the load-bearing one. `delete inst.f` compacts
///   the packed inline slots while PRESERVING `class_id`, so a class-id match
///   alone does not prove the layout: on `class C { a; b; c }`, `delete inst.b`
///   moves `c` from slot 2 to slot 1. The compaction publishes a semantic
///   successor descriptor, so a ShapeId compare against the class's
///   `@perry_class_shape_id_*` global catches it. The check is deliberately
///   DYNAMIC: the `delete` shape barrier that stands the analysis down is
///   module-scoped while receivers alias across modules (#7143), so no static
///   proof is available at this site.
/// * **The sticky `@PERRY_CLASS_FIELD_INLINE_GUARD_DISABLED` latch** — flipped
///   the moment a descriptor / accessor lands on a class prototype or on
///   `Object.prototype`, or typed-feedback tracing turns on. This is the very
///   latch the per-access inline guard *inside the body being replaced* reads,
///   so a routed call is never weaker than the lowering it displaces.
/// * **Per-object `OBJ_FLAG_HAS_DESCRIPTORS`** — instance-level descriptor
///   installs deliberately do NOT flip the process-global latch (#5654), so
///   they are vetted per receiver, exactly as the per-access check does.
/// * **`OBJ_FLAG_FROZEN`** — a proven-receiver clone may contain field WRITES,
///   and a guard-free raw store into a frozen receiver would silently succeed
///   where the spec requires a strict-mode `TypeError`. The clone's own
///   admission rules this out only through a MODULE-scoped freeze-barrier kill,
///   so the receiver is vetted here as well.
/// * **Not-forwarded**, **`GC_TYPE_OBJECT`**, and **not a class object** — the
///   header predicates `js_object_get_class_id` does not itself check.
///
/// Cost: one volatile `i8` load of the latch, three loads off the receiver (two
