//! Flow analysis: locals safe to treat as native-i32 ("integer-valued") even
//! though (at least) one of their writes is a *possibly out-of-bounds* integer
//! typed-array element read or a runtime-guarded numeric-array element read.
//!
//! ## Motivation (bcryptjs `_encipher` Feistel accumulators)
//!
//! ```ignore
//! function _encipher(lr: any, off: number, P: Int32Array, S: Int32Array) {
//!   let l = lr[off], r = lr[off + 1];   // lr is guarded as number[] in the clone
//!   l ^= P[0];                          // only ever bitwise-updated
//!   ... S[l >>> 24] ... S[l & 0xff] ...  // only ever read in bitwise / index ctx
//!   lr[off + 1] = l;                    // exact i32 after the first ^= write
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! `l` / `r` are logically int32, but their declared type is erased to `Any`
//! (the `let l = lr[off]` inference does not propagate the element type). The
//! specialized entry proves `lr` is a numeric array at runtime, but the local
//! representation collector previously ignored that proof. An unbounded
//! `lr[off]` was therefore rejected, so `l` never got an i32 shadow slot and
//! the Feistel loop repeatedly called `js_number_coerce`.
//!
//! ## The soundness trap
//!
//! An integer typed-array or guarded numeric-array element read is numeric only
//! **in-bounds**. An OOB / negative / fractional index yields **`undefined`**
//! (a NaN-boxed value), NOT an integer.
//! (`Uint8ArrayGet` / `BufferIndexGet` have the same Number-or-`undefined`
//! contract as a general typed-array read.) So marking such a local i32
//! unconditionally would let `let x = S[oob]; console.log(x)` print a number
//! (`fptosi(undefined)` garbage / the seeded `0`) where JS prints `undefined`.
//!
//! ## What makes it sound
//!
//! A local is admitted here **only** when BOTH hold:
//!
//! 1. **Every write** produces an i32-representable value OR is an int-kind
//!    typed-array element read (`Int8/Uint8/Uint8Clamped/Int16/Uint16/Int32` —
//!    NOT `Uint32`, NOT the float / bigint kinds), or a numeric-array read
//!    backed by the specialized entry's runtime guard. An erasable source
//!    `number[]` annotation alone is never evidence. Other admitted writes are:
//!    a bitwise op (`& | ^ << >> >>>`), `~`, `Math.imul`, an i32 literal,
//!    `undefined` (the hoisted-`var` seed — `ToInt32(undefined) == 0`, the
//!    slot's seed value), or a `Uint8ArrayGet`/`BufferIndexGet`. NOT `*`
//!    (a single product can exceed 2^53 and round). Additive `+`/`-` is
//!    admitted ONLY under the wrap-i32 extension (`additive_write_admissible`,
//!    representation-selection Phase 2): a STRAIGHT-LINE (never in-loop)
//!    Add/Sub tree over exact-i32 operands (in-bounds-PROVEN int-TA reads,
//!    literals, bitwise results, other candidates), where the slot carries the
//!    ToInt32 image of the true value — sound because rule (2) makes the image
//!    the only thing ever observed, and bounded straight-line chains keep the
//!    true f64 intermediates exactly representable.
//! 2. **Every observation** is in an integer-coercing context — the direct
//!    operand of a bitwise binary/unary op, or the value stored into an
//!    int-kind typed-array / `Uint8Array` / `Buffer` element. The sole narrow
//!    exception is a guarded-array seed followed by a direct bitwise write in
//!    the function's root body, when every subsequent write also produces an
//!    exact i32. That dominating normalization licenses later bare reads.
//!    Otherwise, NEVER a context
//!    where `undefined`-vs-integer is distinguishable (array index, additive
//!    operand, `%`/`/`, comparison, call argument, `return`, `console.log`,
//!    `String()`, `typeof`, property/field/plain-array store, `+` string, …).
//!
//! Under (2) the local's runtime value is *always* fed through `ToInt32`
//! (`ToInt32(undefined) == 0`), and the i32 slot is seeded with the same `0`
//! for an OOB read (see the NaN-safe seed in `stmt/let_stmt.rs`), so the two
//! representations are byte-for-byte indistinguishable — while the fast i32
//! chain is unlocked. A root-level bitwise normalization similarly makes the
//! JavaScript value itself an exact i32; nested normalizations are deliberately
//! ignored because abrupt control flow could bypass them.
//!
//! ## Under-approximation
//!
//! This is deliberately conservative (the #6794 family rule: a correct 1.1×
//! beats an unsound 1.42×). It requires the local to be `let`-declared (params
//! excluded — their incoming argument is an unmodeled write), rejects `++`/`--`
//! targets, rejects any local referenced inside a closure body, and does NOT
//! chase copy chains (`m = l`). Anything unproven is simply left as f64.
//! Rule (1)'s strict arm is judged per write structurally; the wrap-i32
//! additive arm references other candidates, so admission and the rule-(2)
//! walk run to a (small, monotone-shrinking) fixpoint.
//!
//! Gated by `PERRY_INT_VALUED_LOCALS` (default on; `=0`/`off`/`false` disables
//! for A/B bisection — keyed into the object cache in `object_cache.rs`).
