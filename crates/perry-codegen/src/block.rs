//! pass (run automatically by `clang -O2` or higher) to promote them to SSA

    // `PERRY_FAST_MATH=1` env var, or `perry.fastMath` in package.json)

    //
    // What the two independent flags actually buy:
    //   - `reassoc`: lets LLVM reorder `(a + b) + c → a + (b + c)`, which
    //     is what the loop-vectorizer needs to break a serial accumulator
    //     chain into 4 parallel accumulators. The win is real (and large)
    //     on tight `sum += constant` loops — measured ~7x on M-series
    //     ARM64. On data-dependent reductions (`sum += xs[i]`), the
    //     measured win is ~0% (LLVM can't fully vectorize, and Node
    //     vectorizes too where it can).
    //   - `contract`: allow fused multiply-add (FMA). On dot-product
    //     style code (`a*b + c`), allows fusing into a single FMA
    //     instruction with a single rounding step. Measured ~0% effect
    //     on M-series ARM64 in our benchmarks (FMA latency matches
    //     fmul+fadd here; Node also emits FMA where it can).
    //
    // What the two flags break: ECMAScript bit-exact f64 semantics. With
    // both on, ~30% of randomly-generated FP programs diverge from Node
    // by 1 ULP. Examples: `(a/b) * b` gets rewritten to `(a*b) / b`, and
    // `a*b + c` becomes a fused FMA. Without them, ~6% still diverge
    // (residual from the LLVM SLP vectorizer at -O3, not gated by these
    // per-instruction flags). Default is OFF so the bit-exact case is
    // the user's default experience.
    //
    // We deliberately DON'T emit the full `fast` flag set (`nnan ninf nsz
    // arcp contract afn reassoc`) even when fast-math is on. `nnan` and
    // `ninf` in particular are UB-style flags — they tell LLVM to assume
    // no NaN or Inf inputs, which is catastrophic for Perry: NaN-boxing
    // uses NaN bit patterns for EVERY non-number value (strings, objects,
    // null, undefined, booleans). Passing `-ffast-math` to clang was
    // tried briefly at v0.2-era commit 083ce16 and reverted two days
    // later in b5a8c83f because `-ffinite-math-only` (implied by
    // `-ffast-math`) made LLVM replace TAG_NULL / TAG_UNDEFINED
    // constants with 0.0 at codegen time. The clang step passes
    // `-fno-math-errno` only — every fast-math effect in Perry comes
    // from the per-instruction FMFs emitted here.
