//! Regression tests for promise reaction-slot clobbering.
//!
//! A promise carries ONE inline reaction slot (`on_fulfilled` /
//! `on_rejected` / `next`). `js_promise_then` handles multi-reaction
//! promises (first reaction takes the slot, 2nd+ divert to the overflow
//! table), but two other attach paths stored into the slot UNCONDITIONALLY,
//! destroying whatever reaction was already registered:
//!
//! 1. `js_promise_attach_handlers` — used by Promise.all/allSettled/race/any
//!    (via `promise_resolve_for_combinator`, which returns the USER promise
//!    identity) and the stream adapters. `p.then(cb); Promise.all([p])` on a
//!    pending `p` overwrote `cb`; two combinators sharing one pending input
//!    destroyed each other's forwarder, so the loser's remaining-count never
//!    reached zero — a permanent hang. Webpack/Turbopack chunk promises are
//!    shared constants joined via Promise.all in multiple module factories.
//!
//! 2. `js_promise_finally` on a PENDING promise — overwrote the slot AND
//!    nulled `promise.next`, so `p.then(cb); p.finally(end)` lost `cb` and
//!    its chained promise never settled.
//!
//! (The SETTLED-promise `.finally` variant — N settled finallys ran the last
//! wrapper N times — is covered by the settled-arm fix carried in the same
//! PR and guarded by the last test.)
//!
//! All expected outputs are byte-for-byte what `node
//! --experimental-strip-types` prints.
