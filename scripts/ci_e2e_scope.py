"""Compute which integration-test suites a CI run must execute for a diff.

The per-PR `cargo-test` gate runs `--lib --bins` only (see
`scripts/ci_test_scope.py` and the `cargo-test` job in `.github/workflows/
test.yml`): the `crates/<pkg>/tests/*.rs` integration suites are NEVER executed
on a pull request. They each shell out to `perry compile` (~1-6 min apiece,
163 of them in `crates/perry` alone), so running them all per-PR is off the
table — but the consequence was that **a PR's own new acceptance suite could
not fail its own CI** (#5960; #5938 landed with `capture_rereg_renamed_class.rs`
red through green required checks).

This script closes that hole by scoping the e2e tier to the diff: it reads the
changed file paths (one per line) on stdin and prints the suites the diff names,
one `<package> <suite>` pair per line, for `cargo test -p <package> --test
<suite>`.

Selection rules (a suite is a `tests/*.rs` target of a workspace crate):
  * `crates/<dir>/tests/<suite>.rs` — the direct case: an added or modified
    acceptance suite runs. Deleted files are skipped (the target is gone).
  * `crates/<dir>/tests/<suite>/<file>.rs` — a *module directory* of a suite
    (e.g. `perry-codegen/tests/native_proof_regressions/invalidation.rs`, which
    `native_proof_regressions.rs` declares with `mod`): selects `<suite>`.
  * `crates/<dir>/tests/<shared>/...` where no `<shared>.rs` suite exists (e.g.
    a `common/` helper module or a `fixtures/` data dir): every suite in that
    crate can be affected, so all of them are selected.
  * `SOURCE_SUITE_MAP` — one hand-maintained exception to the rule below, for
    `crates/perry-codegen/src/`, whose suites are in-process compiles rather
    than `perry compile` subprocesses. As of #7708 it is COMPLETE for that
    crate and checked to stay so: every `crates/perry-codegen/tests/*.rs` must
    be either mapped or listed in `SUITE_EXCLUSIONS` with its failing test and
    an issue, and `--self-test` fails on one that is neither. See its
    docstring.
  * Everything else selects nothing. In particular a plain `src/` change does
    NOT map to suites: there is no coverage data to map it with, and a
    crate-level map (`perry-codegen` -> all 163 `perry` suites) is exactly the
    full run this scoping exists to avoid. The nightly full `cargo test` stays
    the backstop for regressions in suites the diff does not name.

Cross-host UI crates that don't build on the Linux CI image are excluded
(shared with `ci_test_scope.EXCLUDED`).

The result is capped (`--cap`, default 12) so a mass rename of suites can't turn
one PR into a multi-hour integration run; the overflow is reported and left to
the nightly.

Output is one `<package> <suite> <per-suite timeout seconds>` line per suite.

# The ONE source -> suite mapping (#7507). Hand-maintained and narrow by design.
#
# The general refusal above stands: there is no coverage data, and a crate-level
# map is the full run this scoping exists to avoid. This is a named exception
# with a stated cost.
#
# Why these suites are not like the 163 `perry` ones the rule protects against:
# they are in-process compiles of hand-built HIR with `emit_ir_only: true` — no
# `perry compile` subprocess, no link, no runtime. Measured on arm64 macOS,
# debug, `--test-threads=1`: shadow_slot_hygiene 12 tests / 0.10 s,
# scalar_replaced_slot_roots 11 / 0.12 s, temp_root_operand_temporaries 19 /
# 0.16 s. Under half a second of test time; the cost is the build, which
# `e2e-scoped` already pays whenever any perry-codegen suite is in scope.
#
# Why it exists at all: #7370 changed `crates/perry-codegen/src/` and named no
# suite. `shadow_slot_hygiene` went 0/12 and nothing was red until someone ran
# the nightly tier by hand — the per-PR `cargo-test` gate is `--lib --bins`, so
# it saw none of it.
#
# What changed in #7708: this map listed THREE suites. `crates/perry-codegen/
# tests/` holds 24, and 23 of them are the same kind of thing — in-process
# compiles of hand-built HIR with `emit_ir_only: true`. The narrowness was not a
# judgment about the other 20; it was what one commit had time to verify. Nothing
# said so, and nothing could: a suite that is in neither the map nor any rule is
# indistinguishable from a suite nobody needed to map.
#
# So the map is now COMPLETE-BY-CONSTRUCTION for this crate. `_assert_map_covers_
# codegen_suites` (run by `--self-test`, which the `e2e-scoped` job executes
# before it does anything else) requires every `crates/perry-codegen/tests/*.rs`
# on disk to be either mapped here or named in `SUITE_EXCLUSIONS` below. A new
# suite fails CI until someone classifies it. That is the "cannot silently omit
# a suite" property #7708 asked for; the map is still hand-written, but an
# omission is no longer silent.
#
# Measured on arm64 macOS, debug, `--test-threads=1`, one `cargo test -p
# perry-codegen --test <suite>` per row: every one of the 22 mapped suites
# completes in 2.2-10.4 s wall clock, and nearly all of that is cargo's
# freshness check — the test time itself is sub-second (e.g. shadow_slot_hygiene
# 12 tests / 0.10 s, native_proof_buffer_views 36 / 0.2 s). The cost is the
# build, which `e2e-scoped` already pays whenever any perry-codegen suite is in
# scope. They are NOT like the 163 `perry` suites the general refusal protects
# against: no `perry compile` subprocess, no link, no runtime.
#
# Why it exists at all: #7370 changed `crates/perry-codegen/src/` and named no
# suite. `shadow_slot_hygiene` went 0/12 and nothing was red until someone ran
# the nightly tier by hand — the per-PR `cargo-test` gate is `--lib --bins`, so
# it saw none of it.
#
# Every entry is cross-checked against `tests/` on disk (see `select`): an entry
# naming a suite that does not exist FAILS the scope step rather than silently
# dropping out, the same rule `scripts/gc_root_dominance_allowlist.json` uses.
