# CI gate: fail if any tracked Rust source file exceeds the LOC threshold.
#
# Big single-file modules are hard to read, hard to review, and hurt
# build incrementality (touching one symbol invalidates the IDE +
# cargo-check work for thousands of lines downstream). This script
# enforces an upper bound and is run on every PR.
#
# Threshold is **2,000 lines** as of v0.5.1020. Started at 5,000 in
# v0.5.1019 with the first wave of splits (compile.rs / expr/mod.rs /
# native_table.rs / etc.), tightened to 2,000 once the long-tail
# 2k-5k files were split topically (lower_decl/, inline/, json/,
# stable_hash/, builtins/, array/, monomorph/, publish/, arena/,
# emit/, generator/, js_transform/, modules/, run/, promise/, setup/,
# string/, ir/, runtime_decls/, value/, perry-ui-{macos,ios,android,
# visionos,tvos,windows,gtk4}/, closure/, walker/, dispatch/, lower/,
# buffer/, destructuring/, lower_call/native/, interop/, stmt/, url/,
# bridge/, deforest/, compile/link/, compile/cjs_wrap/, …).
#
# Scope: only checks `*.rs` files. Other formats (JS runtime
# templates, HTML examples, Kotlin templates, JSON fixtures, dist
# bundles) intentionally not policed — they aren't really "review
# surface" the way production Rust is.
#
# Allowlisted (real Rust source, deferred for a specific reason —
# **each entry needs a one-line rationale**):
#
#   - crates/perry-hir/src/ir/expr.rs — a single `pub enum Expr`
#     definition (~2,560 LOC of documented variants). A lone enum
#     cannot be split across files, and decomposing it into nested
#     sub-enums would touch every match site across the codegen +
#     walker stack (a semantic refactor, not a file split). The
#     auxiliary enums and impls were already peeled into siblings;
#     the variant list itself is irreducible.
#
# Vendored third-party sources are also allowlisted (currently
# third_party/windows-winui/*): they are an upstream snapshot, not
# Perry review surface, and must stay byte-identical so the vendor
# drop can be re-diffed. Each still carries its own one-line
# rationale in the ALLOWLIST block below.

# A single ~5,650-LOC function: `run_with_parse_cache`, the per-module `par_iter`
# codegen pipeline with ~30 captured locals threaded through one closure. The
# rest of the old 6,114-line compile.rs was split into compile/ siblings
# (bootstrap/types/run_pipeline/optimized_libs/…); this trunk is now JUST that
# one deeply-coupled function. Decomposing it means extracting a context struct
# for the ~30 locals — high-risk surgery on the compiler's hot path, deferred to
# a focused follow-up. Tracked under #1435.

# node:vm surface: the Script / Module / SourceTextModule / SyntheticModule FFI
# plus a self-contained manifest-expression mini-evaluator (`EvalEnv` + the
# `eval_*` / `normalize_literal_to_json` interpreter). These share one `EvalEnv`,
# a large `FIELD_*` field-key constant set, and ~40 private helpers, so a clean
# split needs a dedicated decomposition (a shared `node_vm/common` module for
# `EvalEnv`/`FIELD_*`/helpers + an `eval` sub-module) rather than a mechanical
# file cut — deferred to a focused follow-up. Tracked under #1435.

# Generator for-of destructuring in function bodies: this PR (#5807) added

# (8 over the gate). The topical split — the #1545 value-read thunks + spec

# cut deferred to a focused follow-up, same pattern as body_stmt.rs above.

# These files crossed the gate on the type-lowering branch (native i32/u32/f64/

# artifact plumbing). Each already delegates to sibling modules where the split
# was mechanical; the remainders are the coupled cores (typed-clone decision
# tables, packed-loop versioning, evidence recording) whose decomposition is a
# focused follow-up under #1435 rather than a merge-time file cut.
